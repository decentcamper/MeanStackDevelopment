         * Next, we use it to get the value of the page’s title element, and we set a property on the $scope, docTitle, on this value.
         * Angular generally discourages accessing the DOM directly, as it operates very
         * much on the principle that a declarative approach is much better.
         * There are times when you need this direct access, however, so it is good to have services such as this one available.
