<!--Using ngRepeat, we loop through the monthlyUsageHistory array and
output each value (which itself is formatted using the number filter).
As Figure 4-5 shows, only the first five items are displayed.
This is because we did not, in fact, loop through the monthlyUsageHistory array.
What we actually did was loop through a totally new array;
an array which was produced by the limitTo filter.-->
