<!--Notice that to produce the month and the day, we use 'MMMM' and 'EEEE',
respectively, which both appear in Table 4-1. You will not, however, see 'ha',
as used to produce the time portion (12AM) in Table 4-1.
You will see an 'h' and an 'a', the former being the hour, and the latter being the AM/PM marker.
It is perfectly acceptable, and often necessary, to combine date parameters in this manner.
<p>This customer joined in the month of {{ data.dateJoined | date:'MMMM'}} on a {{
    data.dateJoined | date:'EEEE'}} at {{ data.dateJoined | date:'ha'}}</p> -->
