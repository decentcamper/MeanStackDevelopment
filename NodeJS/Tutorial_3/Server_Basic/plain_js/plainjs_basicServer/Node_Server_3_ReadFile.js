/**
 *  it calls the fs.readdir function and provides a function that should be called when
 *  all the items in the directory have been loaded.
 *  This callback function has the same prototype that most callbacks
 *  have: an error parameter and a results parameter; you are free to call these whatever you want.
 *
 *
 *
 *  Note that the only parameter to the load_album_list function itself is a callback function.
 *  Because the load_album_list function is itself asynchronous,
 *  it needs to know where to pass the list of albums when it is finished with its work.
 *  It cannot return a value to the caller,
 *  because it will finish executing long before the fs.readdir function calls back to give you the results.
 *
 *
 *
 * Again, this is the core technique of Node application programming:
 * You tell Node to do something and where to send the results when it is done.
 * In the meantime, you go on with other processing.
 * Many of the tasks you have it perform basically end up being a long series of callbacks.
